## TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection
[Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Python/TalkingData.ipynb)<br /> 
[Final Report](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Report/PUBH%207475_Final_Report.pdf)<br /> 
- This Kaggle competition aimed to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will download an application after clicking a mobile advertisement.<br />
- The dataset covers approximately **200 million** clicks, and 8 features are included in train data set. Based on these features, our final predictive model included **21 features**. <br />
- The dataset is **highly imbalanced**. Gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (LightGBM) was chosen as the final model.<br />
**Keywords**: *Python, Data Visualization, Penalized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, XGBoost*

## Prediction of Waste Produced Amount for Company
 [R Code](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/R%20Code/STAT5302_Project.R)<br />
 [Final Report](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Report/STAT5302_Project_Report.pdf)<br /> 
 - I developed a **regression model** to predict the amount of waste produced by a business.<br />
 - The data are got from **147 businesses**, and there are **5 variables** in total, 4 of them are numerical variables and the other one is categorial variable.<br />
 **Keywords**: *R, Statistical Modeling, Regression, Prediction, Outlier Detection, Categorial Variable*
 
## Machine Learning Assignment
[Matlab Code]()<br />
- Implemented several machine learning and deep learning models from scratch.<br />
 **Keywords**: *Matlab, Machine Learning, *
