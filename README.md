## TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection
[Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Python/TalkingData.ipynb)<br /> 
[Final Report](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Report/PUBH%207475_Final_Report.pdf)<br /> 
- This Kaggle competition aimed to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will download an application after clicking a mobile advertisement.<br />
- The dataset covers approximately **200 million** clicks, and 8 features are included in train data set. Based on these features, our final predictive model included **21 features**. <br />
- The dataset is **highly imbalanced**. Gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (**LightGBM**) was chosen as the final model.<br />
**Keywords**: *Python, Data Visualization, Penalized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, XGBoost*

## Prediction of Waste Produced Amount for Company
 [R Code](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/R%20Code/STAT5302_Project.R)<br />
 [Final Report](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Report/STAT5302_Project_Report.pdf)<br /> 
 - I developed a **regression model** to predict the amount of waste produced by a business.<br />
 - The data are got from **147 businesses**, and there are **5 variables** in total, 4 of them are numerical variables and the other one is **categorial variable**.<br />
**Keywords**: *R, Statistical Modeling, Regression, Prediction, Outlier Detection, Categorial Variable*
 
## Machine Learning Assignment
[Matlab Code]()<br />
Implemented several machine learning and deep learning models from scratch.<br />
* [LDA vs PCA](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Matlab%20Code/CSCI%205521/LDA%20&%20PCA)<br />
* [Gaussian Classification](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Matlab%20Code/CSCI%205521/Gaussian%20Classification)<br />
* Run **k-nearest neighbors (KNN)** classification using a subset of the UCI Optdigits dataset, which is composed of **1500 training samples**, and 297 test samples, each with **64 features**. [Code](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Matlab%20Code/CSCI%205521/HW2/Question2)
* Apply **PCA** to visualize the **modified Faces dataset** from the UCI repository, which contains a total of **156 images** in this dataset. There are 4 facial expressions (neutral, happy, sad, angry) and 2 eye states (open, sunglasses) of each of the 20 people in this dataset. [Code](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Matlab%20Code/CSCI%205521/HW2/Question2)
* Implement **K-Means algorithm**, using squared Euclidean distance, to do **image compression** by clustering the pixels in the image file. [Code](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Matlab%20Code/CSCI%205521/HW2/Question3)
* Implement a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** for optical-digit classification [Code]()
* Implement a **Kernel Perceptron** using **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel**. [Code]()
