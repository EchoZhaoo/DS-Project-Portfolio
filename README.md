 [Final Report](https://github.com/EchoZhaoo/DS-Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Report/STAT5302_Project_Report.pdf)<br /> 
 I developed a regression model to predict the amount of waste produced by a business. The data are got from 147 businesses, and there are 5 variables in total, 4 of them are numerical variables and the other one is categorial variable.<br />
 **Keywords**: R, Statistical Modeling, Regression, Prediction, Outlier Detection
